Django E-commerce  
=================

I've built this **Sustainable Products** e-commerce Full Stack Web Application as part of my learning journey of practicing Python and Django Web Framework.

Building this project has thought me a lot and introduced me to a variety of new technologies which I will list out in this document.

Although I am new to Django, I am very much familiar with Web Development in languages I am much more proficient at such as JavaScript, React.js, Next.js, Node.js, HTML and CSS along with related Frameworks and Libraries as well as PostgreSQL.

My prior knowledge of HTML, CSS/Bootsrap, JavaScript and PostgreSQL have served me well in building this **Django E-commerce** web app as they are some of the technologies I used for this project.
