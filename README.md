Django E-commerce  
=================

I've built this **Sustainable Products** e-commerce Full Stack Web Application as part of my learning journey and practicing **Python** and **Django Web Framework**.

Building this project has thought me a lot and introduced me to a variety of new technologies which I will list out in this document.

Although I am new to Django, I am very much familiar with Web Development in languages I am much more proficient at such as *JavaScript*, *React.js*, *Next.js*, *Node.js*, *HTML* and *CSS* along with related *Frameworks* and *Libraries* as well as *PostgreSQL*.

My prior knowledge of *HTML*, *CSS/Bootsrap*, *JavaScript* and *PostgreSQL* have served me well in building this **Django E-commerce** web app as they are some of the technologies I used for this project.

Understanding The Project Structure
-----------------------------------

The main project is called **ecommerce** and can be found in the *ecommerce* directory. I've integrated four django apps in this project, namely: *store*, *accont*, *cart* and *payment*. These apps are responsible for handling different aspects of the project that are correlated to what their individual names suggest.  

The *ecommerce* directory contains important settings, configurations and urls/routes/paths or entry points of the apps to enable us run all of them as one web application smoothly. Having at *settings.py* and *urls.py* in the *ecommerce* directory could give you a better idea as to how the project is structured.
